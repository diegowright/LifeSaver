    // and UIButton's titleLabel is not one of them. This problem can be solved in our
    // custom subclasses by adding the following.
    //
    // The "dynamic" keyword makes this accessible via Objective-C code, which is
    // needed for UIAppearance to set it.
    dynamic var titleLabelFont: UIFont! {
        get { return self.titleLabel?.font }

    // An empty implementation adversely affects performance during animation.
