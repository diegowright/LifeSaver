William Zhang: 30%
- Registration/Login Screen implementation so that users can now be registered, saved etc. 
- The beginnings of our medical info dashboard.
2. Grading Level: Same grade for all members.
3. Differences:
- The settings screen is not very robust currently and that is because we are focused on getting all parts of the application working before we allow for user customization. Allowing for user customization is just one more variable that could go wrong, so we learned itâ€™s easier to add at the end.
- The Medical Info Dashboard is not very robust yet. This is for a couple of reasons first off being our Medical Event Tracker was significantly more difficult than we originally thought it would be. This meant that we had no data yet to get into the medical info dashboard so it was difficult to develop. We now finally have data so it should be easier to implement in a future release. Graphing is also turning out to be much more complicated than we anticipated.
- The data exporter is not included yet as we intend to include it at the end once we successfully know all data has be input. Then we will be able to export ALL data at once, we decided this implementation was easier.
4. Special Instructions: 
-CocoaPods 1.1.0+ is required to build JTApplecalendar.
